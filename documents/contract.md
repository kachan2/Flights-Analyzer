# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings:** Our team plans to meet once each week to check up on each others' progress and to assign new tasks depending on what was accomplished the prior week. Since we will be incrementally developing and testing at the same time, we have not devised a minimum or maximum time for our meetings. Depending on our agenda, our meetings may last for 10 minutes (if everything is on track), or an hour (if we're working to debug an issue or want to collaborate on a specific component to make sure everything interacts smoothly). We plan to either meet in person or call through Discord.  

2. **Assistance:** Our team has created a group chat on Discord where most communication will happen. We should all respond relatively quickly since we are usually active on Discord (expect a response within a period of a day).

3. **Respect:** All the members on our team are pretty laid back and very open minded. Furthermore, we understand that there's multiple ways to approach a project and its components; sometimes another person's algorithm may be easier to implement or may cut down runtime. As such, we are more than willing (but more importantly *expected*) to respect and listen to each other's' ideas. And since we have worked together on assignments in the past, we are fairly comfortable bouncing ideas off each other. In general, we will keep in mind that we should treat each other how we would want to be treated. 

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution:** There are multiple components to our project: parsing data files, creating ways to store our graph, and other tidbits for example. These parts will be split up evenly among the members of our group. Then, we will all come together to build out the final algorithm that implements the functionality of our project. Each week, we will identify which parts or functions we want to complete, and divide up the work.  

5. **Time Commitment:** Each group member is expected to work around 2 hours a week. We understand that each member of group is busy (we are all CAs for other classes) and as such, are willing to work around any conflicts that do occur. If unexpected complications or unforeseen work arises, we are expected to communicate them with the rest of the group in our Discord groupchat, and we will redistribute the work accordingly Depending on each person's availability in the following week, one person may take on a little more and one person may take on a little less (we trust and expect each other to be truthful with their availability schedule).

6. **Conflict Resolution:** Since we have been friends with each other for a while, we understnad each others' work styles and adjust accordingly. For example, if someone doesn't accomplish a task because they don't understand the algorithm, the other members can help. If a member is habitually late to our meetings, we can see if there's another meeting time that works better for them (that also works for the other members). We do not expect to have any large arguments, however, if a conflic arises, we will meet as a group and talk it out. Then maybe some hugs.
